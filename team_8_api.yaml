    This web application is designed to help instructors manage and track
    student project progress throughout the semester, especially in larger
    classes. The system allows projects to be broken down into clear milestones
    and integrates with GitHub to visualize commit histories for real-time
    coding insights. Leveraging Generative AI, the application also analyzes
    documents like proposals and reports to assist in evaluation. A centralized
    dashboard provides an overview of all teams, customizable milestones, and
    AI-powered progress predictions, making it a comprehensive tool for academic
    project management.
